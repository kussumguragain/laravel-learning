This repository represents my personal journey of learning the Laravel PHP framework, as I am transitioning from core PHP to a more structured and modren approach.

What I am learning?
I am following a YouTube channel tutorial series to learn Laravel. As I go through each video I will update this project to show what I built and understood.

I am maintaining this repository to practice laravel concepts hands on, track my progress over time and to stay consistent and organized with my learning.

Tech Stack:
PHP
Laravel Framework
Composer
Git and Github

Feel free to reach out if you are also learning laravel. Let's connect.
